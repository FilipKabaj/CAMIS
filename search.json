    "text": "Background\nTraditionally, highly regulated industries (such as the pharmaceutical industry), have limited themselves to the use of commercially available software. When taking such an approach, the responsibility for the validation and testing of the product was often delegated to the software development company themselves, to ensure the software performs in line with its documentation, producing accurate reliable and reproducible results. However, one downside of this approach is that new methods and functionality can be slow to be adopted, limiting new method implementation and tools that can bring in efficiency.\nWith the increase in popularity of data science, the rate at which community led tools and methods are being developed in open-source software is rapid. The availability of advanced analytic capabilities, has led to increased desire for statistical staff in regulated industries to have access and approval to use to open source software (Rimler et al. 2022). The use of open source software is now widely accepted (FDA 2015), however, this increased variety of tools has resulted in an overlap of capabilities. This has raised challenging questions of traditional approaches to clinical analyses – particularly in situations where the overlap yields different results.\nOne example of this challenge encompasses discrepancies which have been discovered in statistical analysis results between different programming languages, even when working within qualified statistical computing environments. Subtle differences exist between the fundamental approaches and assumptions implemented within each language, yielding differences in results which are correct and consistent with their respective documentation. The fact that these differences exist may cause unease for sponsor companies when submitting to a regulatory agency, as it is uncertain if the agency will view these differences as problematic. By understanding the source of any discrepancies, one can reinstate that confidence.\nThis cross-industry group aims to empower statistical staff to make informed choices on the implementation of statistical analyses when multiple languages yield different results.\nThrough the creation of a white paper the group will provide guidance on the types of questions statistical staff should ask to identify the fundamental sources of discrepant results.\nThe group also aims to save unnecessary repetition of work within the community, through the creation of this open source repository. This repository welcomes contributions from the wider community and is a resource comparing and documenting differences in analysis method implementations in software."

The relevance of this fit is apparent when we consider the availability of the Kenward-Roger’s degrees of freedom for the MMRM in R, which at the time of writing, were not yet available for the nlme::gls function via the pbkrtest package (see here).\n\nlmer(CHG ~ TRTA * VISIT + VISIT + BASE + (0 + VISIT|SUBJID),\n     data = data,\n     control = lmerControl(check.nobs.vs.nRE = \"ignore\"),\n     na.action = na.omit)\n\n\n\nExtracting effect estimates using emmeans\nIn order to extract relevant marginal means (LSmeans) and contrasts we can use the emmeans package. Below we start by constructing a ref_grid used to make explicit just how the predictions are generated across the levels of TRTP and AVISITN. The emmeans function permits various marginal means to be extracted depending on the formula provided and the following pairs() function call derives relevant contrasts. Note that more control can be obtained by calling the contrast() function.\n\nmod_grid <- ref_grid(model, data = data, mode = \"df.error\")\nmod_emm <- emmeans(mod_grid, ~TRTP * AVISITN, mode = \"df.error\") \npairs(mod_emm)"

    "text": "Matching Contrasts: R and SAS\nIt is recommended to use the emmeans package when attempting to match contrasts between R and SAS. In SAS, all contrasts must be manually defined, whereas in R, we have many ways to use pre-existing contrast definitions. The emmeans package makes simplifies this process, and provides syntax that is similar to the syntax of SAS.\nThis is how we would define a contrast in SAS.\n\n# In SAS\nproc glm data=work.mycsv;\n   class drug;\n   model post = drug pre / solution;\n   estimate 'C vs A'  drug -1  1 0;\n   estimate 'E vs CA' drug -1 -1 2;\nrun;\n\nAnd this is how we would define the same contrast in R, using the emmeans package.\n\nlm(formula = post ~ pre + drug, data = df_trial) %>% \n  emmeans(\"drug\") %>% \n  contrast(method = list(\n    \"C vs A\"  = c(-1,  1, 0),\n    \"E vs CA\" = c(-1, -1, 2)\n  ))\n\nNote, however, that there are some cases where the scale of the parameter estimates between SAS and R is off, though the test statistics and p-values are identical. In these cases, we can adjust the SAS code to include a divisor. As far as we can tell, this difference only occurs when using the predefined Base R contrast methods like contr.helmert.\n\nproc glm data=work.mycsv;\n   class drug;\n   model post = drug pre / solution;\n   estimate 'C vs A'  drug -1  1 0 / divisor = 2;\n   estimate 'E vs CA' drug -1 -1 2 / divisor = 6;\nrun;"

However, Bland-Altman type plots showed small but randomly distributed differences across a broad range of parameters from the input data. Apart from a small subset of the parameters, there were no trends observed which would have suggested systemic differences between the languages. These analyses were based on a single set of data so more research must be done. However, based on comparing R documentation with SAS documentation, as well as the results displayed above in this paper, it is evident that the R and the SAS methods cover do produce similarly valid results for the options which were tested.\n\n\nFuture work\n\nRun SAS code by also removing assessments at avisitn=0 from the response variable, and using trtp (or trtpn) and avisit (or avisitn)\nInvestigating the differences\nImplement lmer equivalent to MMRM with compound symmetry\nComparisons for other models, i.e. only random, random and repeated, no repeated"

    "text": "Christina provided a summary of work to date on the website\nRepo now live: [https://psiaims.github.io/CAMIS/]\nPrimary mode of navigation will be the table of contents..\nComprehensive Search function is available to supplement the use of the TOC.\nThe website is build from 3 folders in github:\nR SAS Comp\nThese folders, map to the columns of the table, I.e. everything about R is in Quarto files under R.\nComp folder: for the Comparison – name sure you name the two software you are using r-sas - so we can use this when dynamically selecting.\nIn future we can add Python / Julia directories.\nThe idea would be for people to use the: [CAMIS/templates/R_template.qmd] - A template of how to write documentation for the R part of the site. They’d Edit template & save it back into the R folder naming it clearly for what it is. Template should also contain name packages being used at start of each method comparison. It’d be difficult to be exhaustive with all the survival analysis packages i.e. accelerated failure time packages, etc.., but as long as stated hopefully can grow over time.\nThe Data-info folder – contains description of all data being used for the comparisons. Going forward if different data used, the information about the data would be put into this folder. This allows the data description to sit outside of the comparison folders & where possible same data be used across comparisons.\n\nQuestions & Discussion\nJoe & Michael raised that the About tab which has information about the project is out of date, so should be updated. We also have no detail on the driving mechanism… I.e. what we would like from collaborators. Add “How to collaborate” button.\nItems to be discussed further which may need to be included in the site:\n\nupdate Methods: needs to make it more robust to future uploads - i.e. topics within linear models? (Sub categories) focus on methods, but how sort the methods for inclusion of all in future\nRating the software discrepancies. I..e How severe the difference is?\nNeed to create a template for comparisons. Discuss if we would have a purpose/highlight of comparison/ summary/conclusions at the top first. Also if we put List of R packages this comparison uses (use Tags?) - Need to consider if package superseeded/ multiple packages whether they go in 1 document or multiple.\nHow to expand to sort by: therapeutic area relevance (would be good to link from methods to Oncology somehow\nWhat if a different package.., does same analysis… have to make it clear which package is being used & include multiple packages. It was agreed that as long as we are clear on what we have compared then Its ok to not be all inclusive. That can be added by other collaborators later. It was noted by Kyle that for survival (I.e. accelerated failure time packages), it may be hard to include all. The recommendation is to start with 1 and can expand further as it grows. We may have to re-think website design as it grows to accommodate. Hence why we want everything written in smaller parts to can easily manipulate going forward."
