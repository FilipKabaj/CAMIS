    "text": "Christina provided a summary of work to date on the website\nRepo now live: [https://psiaims.github.io/CAMIS/]\nPrimary mode of navigation will be the table of contents..\nComprehensive Search function is available to supplement the use of the TOC.\nThe website is build from 3 folders in github:\nR SAS Comp\nThese folders, map to the columns of the table, I.e. everything about R is in Quarto files under R.\nComp folder: for the Comparison – name sure you name the two software you are using r-sas - so we can use this when dynamically selecting.\nIn future we can add Python / Julia directories.\nThe idea would be for people to use the: [CAMIS/templates/R_template.qmd] - A template of how to write documentation for the R part of the site. They’d Edit template & save it back into the R folder naming it clearly for what it is. Template should also contain name packages being used at start of each method comparison. It’d be difficult to be exhaustive with all the survival analysis packages i.e. accelerated failure time packages, etc.., but as long as stated hopefully can grow over time.\nThe Data-info folder – contains description of all data being used for the comparisons. Going forward if different data used, the information about the data would be put into this folder. This allows the data description to sit outside of the comparison folders & where possible same data be used across comparisons.\n\nQuestions & Discussion\nJoe & Michael raised that the About tab which has information about the project is out of date, so should be updated. We also have no detail on the driving mechanism… I.e. what we would like from collaborators. Add “How to collaborate” button.\nItems to be discussed further which may need to be included in the site:\n\nupdate Methods: needs to make it more robust to future uploads - i.e. topics within linear models? (Sub categories) focus on methods, but how sort the methods for inclusion of all in future\nRating the software discrepancies. I..e How severe the difference is?\nNeed to create a template for comparisons. Discuss if we would have a purpose/highlight of comparison/ summary/conclusions at the top first. Also if we put List of R packages this comparison uses (use Tags?) - Need to consider if package superseeded/ multiple packages whether they go in 1 document or multiple.\nHow to expand to sort by: therapeutic area relevance (would be good to link from methods to Oncology somehow\nWhat if a different package.., does same analysis… have to make it clear which package is being used & include multiple packages. It was agreed that as long as we are clear on what we have compared then Its ok to not be all inclusive. That can be added by other collaborators later. It was noted by Kyle that for survival (I.e. accelerated failure time packages), it may be hard to include all. The recommendation is to start with 1 and can expand further as it grows. We may have to re-think website design as it grows to accommodate. Hence why we want everything written in smaller parts to can easily manipulate going forward."

The relevance of this fit is apparent when we consider the availability of the Kenward-Roger’s degrees of freedom for the MMRM in R, which at the time of writing, were not yet available for the nlme::gls function via the pbkrtest package (see here).\n\nlmer(CHG ~ TRTA * VISIT + VISIT + BASE + (0 + VISIT|SUBJID),\n     data = data,\n     control = lmerControl(check.nobs.vs.nRE = \"ignore\"),\n     na.action = na.omit)\n\n\n\nExtracting effect estimates using emmeans\nIn order to extract relevant marginal means (LSmeans) and contrasts we can use the emmeans package. Below we start by constructing a ref_grid used to make explicit just how the predictions are generated across the levels of TRTP and AVISITN. The emmeans function permits various marginal means to be extracted depending on the formula provided and the following pairs() function call derives relevant contrasts. Note that more control can be obtained by calling the contrast() function.\n\nmod_grid <- ref_grid(model, data = data, mode = \"df.error\")\nmod_emm <- emmeans(mod_grid, ~TRTP * AVISITN, mode = \"df.error\") \npairs(mod_emm)"

    "text": "Background\nTraditionally, highly regulated industries (such as the pharmaceutical industry), have limited themselves to the use of commercially available software. When taking such an approach, the responsibility for the validation and testing of the product was often delegated to the software development company themselves, to ensure the software performs in line with its documentation, producing accurate reliable and reproducible results. However, one downside of this approach is that new methods and functionality can be slow to be adopted, limiting new method implementation and tools that can bring in efficiency.\nWith the increase in popularity of data science, the rate at which community led tools and methods are being developed in open-source software is rapid. The availability of advanced analytic capabilities, has led to increased desire for statistical staff in regulated industries to have access and approval to use to open source software (Rimler et al. 2022). The use of open source software is now widely accepted (FDA 2015), however, this increased variety of tools has resulted in an overlap of capabilities. This has raised challenging questions of traditional approaches to clinical analyses – particularly in situations where the overlap yields different results.\nOne example of this challenge encompasses discrepancies which have been discovered in statistical analysis results between different programming languages, even when working within qualified statistical computing environments. Subtle differences exist between the fundamental approaches and assumptions implemented within each language, yielding differences in results which are correct and consistent with their respective documentation. The fact that these differences exist may cause unease for sponsor companies when submitting to a regulatory agency, as it is uncertain if the agency will view these differences as problematic. By understanding the source of any discrepancies, one can reinstate that confidence.\nThis cross-industry group aims to empower statistical staff to make informed choices on the implementation of statistical analyses when multiple languages yield different results."

In contrast to R, SAS outputs the Kappa coefficients with confident limits as default.\n\nproc freq data=data1;\n    tables before*after / agree or riskdiff;\nrun;\n\nWhen calculating the odds ratio and risk difference confidence limits, SAS is not treating the data as matched-pairs. There is advice on the SAS blog and SAS support page to amend this, which requires a lot of additional coding.\nR is using Edward’s continuity correction with no option to remove this. This is consistent with other functions within the package. The epibasix package was categorised as ‘High Risk’ by the Risk Assessment Shiny App created by R Validation Hub. There is no option to include Edward’s continuity correction in SAS but this can be manually coded to agree with R. However, its use is controversial due to being seen as overly conservative.\nThe mcnemar.test function in the stats package provides the option to remove continuity corrections which results in a match with SAS. This function does not output any other coefficients for agreement/difference in proportions etc. but (if required) these can be achieved within other functions and/or packages.\n\nmcnemar.test(X, correct = FALSE)"

    "text": "Rounding; R and SAS\nOn comparing the documentation of rounding rules for both languages, it will be noted that the default rounding rule (implemented in the respective language’s round() function) are different. Numerical differences arise in the knife-edge case where the number being rounded is equidistant between the two possible results. The round() function in SAS will round the number ‘away from zero’, meaning that 12.5 rounds to the integer 13. The round() function in Base R will round the number ‘to even’, meaning that 12.5 rounds to the integer 12. SAS does provide the rounde() function which rounds to even and the janitor package in R contains a function round_half_up() that rounds away from zero. In this use case, SAS produces a correct result from its round() function, based on its documentation, as does R. Both are right based on what they say they do, but they produce different results (Rimler, M.S. et al.).\nReferences\nRimler M.S., Rickert J., Jen M-H., Stackhouse M.

Results not being exact can be attributed to many factors such as rounding precision, data handling, and many other internal processing nuances. However, Bland-Altman type plots showed small but randomly distributed differences across a broad range of parameters from the input data. Apart from a small subset of the parameters, there were no trends observed which would have suggested systemic differences between the languages. These analyses were based on a single set of data so more research must be done. However, based on comparing R documentation with SAS documentation, as well as the results displayed above in this paper, it is evident that the R and the SAS methods cover do produce similarly valid results for the options which were tested.\n\n\nFuture work\n\nRun SAS code by also removing assessments at avisitn=0 from the response variable, and using trtp (or trtpn) and avisit (or avisitn)\nInvestigating the differences\nImplement lmer equivalent to MMRM with compound symmetry\nComparisons for other models, i.e. only random, random and repeated, no repeated"
