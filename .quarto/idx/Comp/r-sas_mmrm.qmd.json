Results were generated for each lab parameter and time point in the dataset using three different covariance structures, i.e. unstructured, compound symmetry and autoregressive of first order (AR(1)).\n\n### Comparison between SAS and R\n\nWith results available for SAS and R model fits, we turn our attention to generating some visual comparisons of the results. Note that here we adopt a Bland-Altman type plot which plots the difference on the y-axis and the average on the x-axis. This offers a way to inspect any bias or relationships with the size of effect and the associated bias.\n\nFor the extracted LS-means\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n#| out.width: \"100%\"\nplots$lsmeans_bland_alt_emmean$`Unstructured (KR)`\nplots$lsmeans_bland_alt_emmean$`Unstructured (satterthwaite)`\nplots$lsmeans_bland_alt_emmean$`Heterogeneous Compound Symmetry`\nplots$lsmeans_bland_alt_emmean$`Heterogeneous First Order Autoregressive`\n```\n\nand corresponding SEs\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\nplots$lsmeans_bland_alt_se$`Unstructured (KR)`\nplots$lsmeans_bland_alt_se$`Unstructured (satterthwaite)`\nplots$lsmeans_bland_alt_se$`Heterogeneous Compound Symmetry`\nplots$lsmeans_bland_alt_se$`Heterogeneous First Order Autoregressive`\n```\n\nFor the derived contrasts\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\nplots$contrasts_bland_alt_estimate$`Unstructured (KR)`\nplots$contrasts_bland_alt_estimate$`Unstructured (satterthwaite)`\nplots$contrasts_bland_alt_estimate$`Heterogeneous Compound Symmetry`\nplots$contrasts_bland_alt_estimate$`Heterogeneous First Order Autoregressive`\n```\n\nand corresponding 95%CI widths\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\nplots$contrasts_bland_alt_ci$`Unstructured (KR)`\nplots$contrasts_bland_alt_ci$`Unstructured (satterthwaite)`\nplots$contrasts_bland_alt_ci$`Heterogeneous Compound Symmetry`\nplots$contrasts_bland_alt_ci$`Heterogeneous First Order Autoregressive`\n```\n\n### Analysis of SAS and R Comparison\n\nUsing SAS PROC MIXED and R functions such as gls, lmer, mod_grid, and mod_emm, results were broadly aligned. Results not being exact can be attributed to many factors such as rounding precision, data handling, and many other internal processing nuances. However, Bland-Altman type plots showed small but randomly distributed differences across a broad range of parameters from the input data. Apart from a small subset of the parameters, there were no trends observed which would have suggested systemic differences between the languages. These analyses were based on a single set of data so more research must be done. However, based on comparing R documentation with SAS documentation, as well as the results displayed above in this paper, it is evident that the R and the SAS methods cover do produce similarly valid results for the options which were tested.\n\n### Future work\n\n-   Run SAS code by also removing assessments at `avisitn=0` from the response variable, and using `trtp` (or `trtpn`) and `avisit` (or `avisitn`)\n-   Investigating the differences\n-   Implement `lmer` equivalent to MMRM with compound symmetry\n-   Comparisons for other models, i.e. only random, random and repeated, no repeated\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"r-sas_mmrm.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo","title":"R vs SAS MMRM"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
